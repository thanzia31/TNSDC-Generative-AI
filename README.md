## Title:Content Moderation for text and image using Tensorflow

## Overview
This project focuses on developing an AI solution for content moderation, which is crucial for maintaining online safety and integrity. The goal is to analyze text and images to detect inappropriate content, particularly offensive language and imagery, using deep learning techniques. The project leverages Keras and TensorFlow for deep learning implementation.

## Dataset Information
The project utilizes a dataset sourced from Twitter, specifically for hate-speech detection research. The dataset categorizes text into three classes: hate-speech, offensive language, and neither. It's important to note that the dataset contains text that may be considered racist, sexist, homophobic, or generally offensive.
